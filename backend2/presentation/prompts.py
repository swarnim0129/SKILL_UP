The outline should be in {actual_language} language and it very important.

Current Date: {current_date}
Topic: {topic}

First, generate an appropriate title for the presentation, then create exactly {num_slides} main topics that would make for an engaging and well-structured presentation.

Format the response starting with the title in XML tags, followed by markdown content with each topic as a heading and 2-3 bullet points.

Example format:
<TITLE>Your Generated Presentation Title Here</TITLE>

# First Main Topic
- Key point about this topic
- Another important aspect
- Brief conclusion or impact

# Second Main Topic
- Main insight for this section
- Supporting detail or example
- Practical application or takeaway

Make sure the topics:
1. Flow logically from one to another
2. Cover the key aspects of the main topic
3. Are clear and concise
4. Are engaging for the audience
5. ALWAYS use bullet points (not paragraphs) and format each point as "- point text"
6. Do not use bold, italic or underline
7. Keep each bullet point brief - just one sentence per point
8. Include exactly 2-3 bullet points per topic (not more, not less)

Return ONLY the formatted outline with title in XML tags, nothing else."""
